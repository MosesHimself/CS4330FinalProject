## Procedural programming

* Does the language support procedural programming?

# Java
* Java does not support procedural programming, since every function must be inside of a class. It was designed to be purely object oriented.

# PHP
* Much more flexible than Java, PHP allows for procedural programming, where functions can stand alone. 

# C#
* Like PHP, C# allows both procedural programming and object oriented programming styles.
