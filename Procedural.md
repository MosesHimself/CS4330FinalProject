## Procedural programming

* Does the language support procedural programming?

# Java
* Java does not support procedural programming, since every function must be inside of a class. It was designed to be purely object oriented.

# PHP
* Much more flexible than Java, PHP allows for procedural programming, where functions can stand alone. 

# C#
* Like PHP, C# allows both procedural programming and object oriented programming styles.

# Summary
* To restate what is said in the Functional programming section, it really depends on what the programmer prefers to use when it comes to programming paradigms. Languages these days seem to blur the lines between object oriented, procedural, and functional. By allowing multiple style of programming, the tool becomes more useful and work in many more situations.
