## Functional programming

##Does it support functional programming?
  -Java
    No, Java does not support functional programming. All functions or code must be inside of a class. The term for this is   
    a closure; a record storing function together with an environment.
  -PHP
    Yes, PHP supports functional programming. There are numerous examples in their documentation which show how to do things 
    both in an object oriented or a functional style
  -C#
    Like PHP, C# does support functional programming in the essence that functions can stand alone outside of a class. 
    
  -Summary
    From much of my research, I found a lot of mixed opinions on whether some of these languages are functional, procedural, 
    object oriented, etc. What I make of this is that possibly there is no right answer. Some languages, like Java, don't 
    necessarily support functional programming, but there are ways to use a functional style. PHP as well as C# aren't purely 
    functional, the programmer chooses which style to use when they write. According to the programming paradigms wikipedia   
    page it says "Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on the features of various 
    programming languages." I feel though, that the paradigm is based more off of the combination of the programming language 
    and the programmer using it. For example, if you have a lighter but use it as a bottle opener 
    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly24ycL1lRI), would you consider it a lighter or a bottle opener? I think that depends on 
    what you want to use it for.
