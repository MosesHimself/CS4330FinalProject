# Langauge Purpose / genesis 
## Java
* ### Why was the language created?:
Java was created to be used on various different platforms that supported Java. The goal was to create a language with as few dependencies as possible. This was done by using the Java virtual machine (JVM) which allows for the ease of cross platform support. They also created the language specifically to be as familiar as possible for the developer to use, to increase readability and reduce complexity in code.


[Java Principles from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
1. It must be "simple, object-oriented, and familiar".
2. It must be "robust and secure".
3. It must be "architecture-neutral and portable".
4. It must execute with "high performance".
5. It must be "interpreted, threaded, and dynamic".

* ### What problems was the language trying to address?:
Java tried addressing memory management. They did this by implementing a garbage collection system that manages memory for the developer, so much so, that the developer cannot access memory. Another problem Java attempted to address is the complexity of other object- programming languages. They did this by implementing a vast library of functions and documentation that is very easy and descriptive for the developer to read and access.
* ### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?:
Java was a reaction to the previous dominant language of C++. It tried to fix some of the flaws of C++, while still using the object- oriented concepts C++ used.
## PHP
* ### Why was the language created?:
PHP was created to be a serverside scripting language, to be used with HTML and other web development languages.
* ### What problems was the language trying to address?:
The language was trying to address the gap between web forms and databases. The language was originally designed to be used as a scripting language to read and write from databases. It was also trying to address the issue of imbedding scripts and variables within HTML.
* ### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?:
[Wikipedia on PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)
"Lerdorf did not intend the early PHP to become a new programming language, but it grew organically, with Lerdorf noting in retrospect: "I don’t know how to stop it, there was never any intent to write a programming language […] I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language, I just kept adding the next logical step on the way."
## C#
* ### Why was the language created?:
C# was created to be a object- oriented programming language based on C.
* ### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?:
C# was a reaction to C, it added object- oriented concepts to C.
* ### What problems was the language trying to address?:
C# attempted to address portability, memory and processing requirements of C, increase simplicity, and add software engineering principles not included in C.
